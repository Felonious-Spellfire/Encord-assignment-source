# Encord Assignment


## Possible Improvements:


Looking over the Encord docs I would make the following recommendations:

- The structure of the SDK help is a little confusing. The entries in "Tutorials" are more like how-tos. I would expect tutorials to show some real world data, not just some code with variables.

- End-to-end: A quick start for the product would be helpful and end-to-end examples (of using critical features, each product, and using all three products together) would really speed up how quickly your users are successful. The existing end-to-end examples (from what I am looking at) simply bring the code I need for multiple topics into one large topic. Good tutorial and end-to-end examples include real world data, not just code with variables.

- Content reuse: There is information in the Web-App content that would be useful in the API content. Supported file considerations and upload specs would really help when creating a dataset. Even basic things like the definitions of terms/features could be shared (datasets for example appears in the "General Concepts" topic and then again in the "Datasets topic.

- Grammar and spell check the documents: The second link I clicked in the assignment PDF had the following text in the live content: "If you just **with** to upload your data from local storage to Encord, CORD_STORAGE would be the appropriate choice." In the Introduction to Encord topic in the Web-App help dataset is spelt "dataset" and "data set". There are a number of tools that can do this (Grammarly for grammar) though it might add some manual work to self reviews or reviews in general.

- Controlled English: Consider adopting a more ESL friendly way of writing. Translation isn't usually done instantly, so your audience that are ESL will have an easier time of reading the latest English content and native speaks will appreciate the more direct writing. Though I do understand that more conversational writing has been the trend for some time now. It's a style choice, but one that shouldn't be taken lightly.


## Author, Store, Publish

There are many authoring, storage, and publishing solutions available. There is no one tool or tech stack that is perfect for every situation. It all comes down to what your requirements are for your documentation. I can go into a lot more detail on this with you if you like. For this assignment I went with Markdown and GitHub for authoring and storage.
